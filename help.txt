NAME :
Naman Modi , Bhaskar Pardeshi, Shivam Marathe
Naman helped to understand the logic while printing the lines in between two lines of the LCS
Bhaskar suggested the data structure used in clist.c and also helped to understand the logic while doing patch (for -c o/p of diff)where I had skipped printing of first part of hunk and started printing from the patchfile(containg diff's output)
Bhaskar suggested use of struct stat and struct dirent for reading directories
Shivam Marathe helped in using optind in getopt.h
